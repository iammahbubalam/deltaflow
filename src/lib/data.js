// FAQ
// ======================
export const faqs = [

    question: "How long does a typical AI project take?",
    answer: "Most projects take 10-16 weeks from kickoff to deployment. This includes discovery (1-2 weeks), design (2-3 weeks), development (6-12 weeks), and deployment (1-2 weeks). We provide a detailed timeline during discovery."
  },
  {
    id: "pricing",
    category: "General",
    question: "What's the investment range for an AI project?",
    answer: "Projects typically range from $75K to $500K+ depending on complexity. We provide a detailed proposal with fixed pricing after the discovery phase."
  },
  {
    id: "company-size",
    category: "General",
    question: "Do you work with startups or only enterprises?",
    answer: "We work with both. Our sweet spot is companies with 50-5000 employees, but we evaluate each project individually based on business impact and technical fit."
  },
  {
    id: "post-deployment",
    category: "Process",
    question: "What happens after deployment?",
    answer: "We offer ongoing support packages that include monitoring, maintenance, model retraining, and feature enhancements. Many clients choose annual support contracts."
  },
  {
    id: "data-science-team",
    category: "Technical",
    question: "Do we need our own data science team?",
    answer: "No. We can handle the entire project independently. However, we integrate seamlessly with your existing engineering and product teams."
  },
  {
    id: "technologies",
    category: "Technical",
    question: "What technologies do you use?",
    answer: "We're technology-agnostic and choose the best tools for each project. Common stack: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, FastAPI, React, AWS/GCP/Azure. We document everything clearly."
  },
  {
    id: "data-requirements",
    category: "Technical",
    question: "How much data do we need for an AI project?",
    answer: "It depends on the project. For custom ML models, typically 10K+ labeled examples. For LLM-based solutions, we can work with smaller datasets using fine-tuning and prompt engineering. We assess data requirements during discovery."
  },
  {
    id: "ownership",
    category: "Legal",
    question: "Who owns the code and models?",
    answer: "You do. All code, models, and intellectual property developed for your project belongs to you. We sign IP assignment agreements as part of our standard contracts."
  },
  {
    id: "security-compliance",
    category: "Security",
    question: "Are your solutions secure and compliant?",
    answer: "Yes. We follow security best practices and can build HIPAA, SOC2, and GDPR-compliant solutions. We perform security audits and can work within your compliance requirements."
  },
  {
    id: "maintenance",
    category: "Process",
    question: "Do you provide ongoing maintenance?",
    answer: "Yes. We offer flexible support packages including 24/7 monitoring, model retraining, bug fixes, and feature updates. Support can be hourly, monthly retainer, or annual contracts."
  },
  {
    id: "guarantees",
    category: "General",
    question: "Do you guarantee specific accuracy or performance?",
    answer: "We set realistic performance targets during discovery based on your data and requirements. While we can't guarantee specific metrics before seeing your data, we don't consider a project complete until agreed-upon benchmarks are met."
  },
  {
    id: "payment-terms",
    category: "Business",
    question: "What are your payment terms?",
    answer: "Typically 30% upfront, 40% at halfway milestone, and 30% upon deployment. For longer projects, we can arrange monthly billing. We're flexible and can accommodate your procurement process."
  },
  {
    id: "location",
    category: "General",
    question: "Do you work with remote clients?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We work with clients globally and are experienced with remote collaboration. We adapt our communication schedule to your timezone."
  },
  {
    id: "nda",
    category: "Legal",
    question: "Can you sign an NDA?",
    answer: "Yes, we regularly work under NDAs and can sign yours or provide ours. We take confidentiality seriously and all team members sign confidentiality agreements."
  },
  {
    id: "demo",
    category: "Process",
    question: "Can we see a demo before committing?",
    answer: "During the discovery phase, we often build a proof-of-concept or prototype to validate the approach. This helps ensure the solution will work before full development begins."
